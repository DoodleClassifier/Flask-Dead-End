# How to run (Eren please read this before texting me I beg)
1. Clone repo onto desktop
2. Navigate to the folder in command line
3. run "node app.js" to start the server (might be different in windows? not sure, make sure node.js is installed on your computer)
4. Open a browser and go to localhost:8080

Keep this server open as long as you want, when you make changes simply refresh the web page for the changes to take effect.
